# syntax-checker
The core functionality of this tool is based on invoking a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the provided source code file and checking the result. If there are any syntax errors or compilation issues, it captures and displays the error messages for the user to review.  The tool aims to provide a simple, automated way for developers to check errors.
